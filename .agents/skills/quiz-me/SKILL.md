# Quiz Me

Generate a short multiple-choice quiz about code in this auction app codebase. Questions should be based on actual code that exists in the project right now, not generic programming trivia.

## How It Works
1. Read the codebase to understand what is currently built.
2. Generate 5 questions based on real code.
3. Present questions one at a time and wait for the student's answer.
4. After each answer, explain why the correct answer is correct and reference the specific file and code.
5. After all questions, give a summary score with suggested areas to review.

## Question Types

Mix these across the 5 questions:  
- **What does this do?**: Show a small snippet from the codebase and ask what it does.
- **What would happen if?**: Ask what would happen if a concrete piece were removed or changed.
- **Where does this live?**: Ask which file handles a specific behavior.
- **Why this approach?**: Ask why a component uses one approach instead of another based on real implementation choices.
- **Spot the dependency**: Ask which components or behavior would break if a concrete dependency changed.  

## Question Rules
- Provide 4 answer choices per question (A-D).
- Include exactly one correct answer.
- Make wrong answers plausible, not silly.
- Reference real code in the project for every question and cite the file path.
- Scale difficulty to what has been built so far and avoid asking about unimplemented phases.
- Avoid trick questions; prioritize confidence and learning.

## Presenting Questions

Format each question like this:
```markdown
### Question 1 of 5

In `src/components/BidButton.tsx`, what happens when the server returns an error after placing a bid?

A) The page refreshes automatically
B) An error toast is shown and the button re-enables
C) The bid is retried up to 3 times
D) The component unmounts and redirects to the listings page
```

Wait for the student's answer before revealing the explanation.  

## After Each Answer
Use this response style:

```markdown
Nice one! / Good effort, let's look at why. The answer is B.

The `handleBid` function in `src/components/BidButton.tsx` catches the error
and calls `toast.error()` to show the message, then sets `isLoading` back to
false which re-enables the button. You can see this in the catch block.
```

Keep explanations to 2-3 sentences, reference the file, and be specific.

## After All Questions

Use this summary format:

```markdown
## Score: X/5

Strong areas: [what they got right; name the concepts]
Worth reviewing: [what they got wrong; name the files and concepts to revisit]
```
## Tone
- Keep tone encouraging, not exam-like.
- Prefer phrasing like "Nice one!" and "Good effort, let's look at why...".
- Optimize for learning and confidence, not assessment.
